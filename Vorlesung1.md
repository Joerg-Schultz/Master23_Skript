# Python 1
## Variables
### Numbers

- int
- float
- complex

### Strings
- 'bla' and "blub"
- Show addition int + string
    - type conversion
- print(f"{bla}")
- String multiplication: String * 2
- Strings are arrays already -> positions (Maybe use this to introduce array concepts?)
- len(string)
- \n, \t

### Boolean

- introduce the concept True/False (1/0)
- introduce equal, and, or


**Exercise** Variables
- Variable Definition
    - Run this without any changes locally.
    - Show error, show how you can jump to code.
    - Once everything is fixed, -> check
- Undefined Variable
- Variable Types
- Type Conversion

## Debugger

**Exercise** swap the value of two variables, then follow in debugger

## Mathematical operations

- assignment
- math
- show addition of int and String

**Exercises** Variables
- Arithmetic Operators
- Assignments
- Boolean Operators
- Comparison Operators

## List
Don't talk about arrays here, just lists.
Lists can consist of elements belonging to different data types,
Arrays only consists of elements belonging to the same data type.
You have to import a module to use arrays.
- slicing
    - Note that the symbol with the index ind1 will be included, while the symbol with the index ind2 â€“ won't.
    - [1:7]
    - [0:5] == [:5]
- Empty lists are considered False in Python
- in keyword
- Stacks and Queues?
- nested lists = matrices
- ? Tuples: The only significant difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable
- List comprehension?
- sort

**Exercise** Data structures
- Lists introduction
- Lists operations
- List items
- Nested lists
- Join method

## Strings

I put them after lists, as many string operations make only sense if you see Strings as lists of characters

**Exercise** Strings
